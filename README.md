# Hackathon data pack: Problem 3: Group Travel Matcher

Everything your team needs for this problem.

## Start here

| Step | Read | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `problem-3-group-travel-matcher.md` | The problem statement: what to build, the rules, and how we judge |
| 2 | `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` | What each data file is, how the files link, every field, a worked example, and a data FAQ |
| 3 | `data/` | The mock data (below) |

## The data in this pack

| File | One record is | Your app uses it to |
|---|---|---|
| `data/problem-3/travellers.json` | One traveller profile | Users who already exist at the start. Group owners and members come from here. |
| `data/problem-3/groups.json` | One open group post | Group posts that already exist at the start, so a search has results (M4) |
| `data/problem-3/interests.json` | One interest tag | The interest list in the sign-up form (M1) and the search form (M3) |
| `data/catalog/destinations.json` | The list of cities and countries | The city list in the group post form (M2) and the search form (M3) |
| `data/catalog/hotels.json` | One hotel | Hotel search on the Common Group Page (M6) |
| `data/catalog/rooms.json` | One room type in one hotel | Room capacity and price per night (M6) |
| `data/catalog/availability.json` | One room type on one night | Free rooms on each night of the group's stay (M6) |
| `images/hotels/` | One hotel photo (JPG) | Show hotel photos (optional). Credits: `images/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`. |

All data is synthetic, except the photos (real photos with free licenses; see `images/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`). All times are local times. All prices are in INR. The data files are read-only: keep your own data in your own database.

## Rules (short version)

1. Any language, framework, and database. AI tools to help you write code are allowed. **Your app must not call an AI or LLM model.**
2. Build a **backend** and a **frontend** that work together. The frontend gets data from your backend, not from the files.
3. Do not change the data files. Judges use the same files.
4. Write feature code during the event. Push to Git every hour.
5. Your app must start with 1–2 commands. Write them in your README.
6. At code freeze, upload a zip to HackerEarth (no `node_modules`, no virtual environments, no API keys).

## Questions

Read the FAQ at the end of `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` first. Then ask at the help desk or in the event chat channel. We send every answer to all teams.

## Running Nomad (our app)

Needs Node 20.12+ and Docker (for Postgres).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
docker compose up -d        # Postgres 16 on localhost:5432
npm run db:migrate          # create users and sessions tables
npm run dev                 # API on :4000, web on :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Check the API with http://localhost:5173/api/health.

| Folder | What |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | React + TypeScript + Vite frontend |
| `apps/api` | Express + TypeScript API, Drizzle ORM on Postgres |
| `packages/shared` | Zod schemas and types used by both apps |
| `docs/api-contract.md` | Request/response formats both teams build against |

After changing `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`, run `npm run db:generate` then `npm run db:migrate`.
Other scripts: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`.
